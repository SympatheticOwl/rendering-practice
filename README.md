# UIUC CS418 Course Work

* These are most of the optional elective course work from UIUC cs418 fall 2024
* Some of the projects accept user input that is not documented in the UI so you'll have to read through the driver class to figure it out
* `parametric` torus has some seam issues I never got around to fixing
* `goop` does not work as intended `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
* `warmup-anylang` was written in raw clang because clang is the best language and I am definitely not a masochist. Requires `libpng` be installed somewhere 

To view these components go to the base directory and start a webserver. Easiest way would be with the command:
```python
python -m http.server
```
Then go into any folder and click on the html file
